CREDIT CARD WEEKLY STATUS REPORT

Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Insights we get through these:

1. Sales Performance Trends  
   - Monthly/Yearly growth trends in credit card sales.  
   - Comparison of sales across time periods to identify peak seasons or months.  

2. Top Performing Categories/Regions  
   - Identify regions or locations with the highest and lowest sales.  
   - Analyze product or service categories that drive the most revenue.  

3. Customer Segmentation  
   - Insights into customer demographics (e.g., age groups, gender) and their spending habits.  
   - Identify high-value customers based on total spending or transaction frequency.  

4. Transaction Volume Analysis  
   - Total number of transactions and average transaction value.  
   - Identify periods of high transaction activity (e.g., weekends, holidays).  

5. Payment Mode Insights  
   - Trends in credit card usage compared to other payment methods (if available).  
   - Insights into the type of credit cards used (e.g., premium cards vs. basic cards).  

6. Regional Comparison  
   - A regional heatmap showcasing areas with the highest credit card penetration.  
   - Regions with potential for growth based on low sales but high transaction potential.  

7. Customer Behavior Patterns  
   - Identify trends such as preferred shopping days, times, or seasons.  
   - Insights into repeat customers vs. new customer behavior.  

8. Profitability Analysis  
   - Correlation between sales and profitability (if profit data is available).  
   - Contribution of high-margin products or services to overall sales.  

9. Market Trends and Opportunities
   - Emerging trends in consumer spending (e.g., increased spending in certain categories or services).  
   - Opportunities to target specific demographics or regions based on sales data.  

10. Performance Metrics  
    - KPIs like total sales, average transaction value, customer acquisition rate, and churn rate.
